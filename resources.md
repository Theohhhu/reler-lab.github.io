University-1652 is a multi-view multi-source benchmark for drone-based geo-localization that contains 1652 buildings of 72 universities around the world. We provide images collected from the virtual drone, the satellite and the ground.

Task 1: Drone-view target localization. (Drone -> Satellite)} Given one drone-view image or video, the task aims to find the most similar satellite-view image to localize the target building in the satellite view.

Task 2: Drone navigation. (Satellite -> Drone)} Given one satellite-view image, the drone intends to find the most relevant place (drone-view images) that it has passed by. According to its flight history, the drone could be navigated back to the target place.

### 2. DG-Market

We provide our generated images and make a large-scale synthetic dataset called DG-Market. This dataset is generated by our DG-Net (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07223) and consists of 128,307 images (613MB), about 10 times larger than the training set of original Market-1501 (even much more can be generated with DG-Net). It can be used as a source of unlabeled training dataset for semi-supervised learning. You may download the dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/126Gn90Tzpk3zWp2c7OBYPKc-ZjhptKDo/view?usp=sharing) (or [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1n4M6s-qvE08J8SOOWtWfgw) password: qxyh).
