<!--[Konrad Kording](http://koerding.com/) runs his lab at the University of Pennsylvania.-->
<!--Konrad is interested in the question of how the brain solves the credit assignment problem and-->
<!--similarly how we should assign credit in the real world (through causality). In extension-->
<!--of this main thrust he is interested in applications of causality in biomedical research.-->
<!--Konrad has trained as student at ETH Zurich with Peter Konig, as postdoc at UCL London with Daniel-->
<!--Wolpert and at MIT with Josh Tenenbaum. After a decade at Northwestern University he is now-->
<!--PIK professor at UPenn.-->
